I am an undergraduate student in Information Technology with a strong focus on systems development and automation. I have experience in building web applications (both frontend and backend) and I am passionate about learning new technologies to create useful, efficient, and scalable solutions.

I am interested in Fullstack Development and Automation

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on personal and technical projects involving:

REST APIs

Fullstack systems with Next.js, React Native and MySQL

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on IT projects where I can grow professionally and contribute with my skills.

âœ” Ask me about anything related to React, Next.js, Python (Flask), SQL, or automation systems, Iâ€™ll be happy to help if I can! ðŸ˜‰<br>

Outside tech, I enjoy teamwork, effective communication, and always aim for quality and excellence in everything I do.
